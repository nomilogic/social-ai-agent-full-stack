# ContentInput Component Test Results

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented conditional media upload functionality in the ContentInput component:

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Post Type Selection**
   - Added three clickable post type options: Text, Image, and Video
   - Each option uses purple gradient styling when selected
   - Includes proper icons (MessageSquare, ImageIcon, Play) and descriptions

2. **Conditional Media Upload Display**
   - Media upload section only appears when "Image" or "Video" post types are selected
   - Hidden completely for "Text" post type
   - Properly wrapped the entire upload area including drag-and-drop zone, file preview, AI analysis, and template features

3. **Dynamic File Input Accept Attribute**
   - Image post type: accepts only `image/*`
   - Video post type: accepts only `video/*`  
   - Text post type: no file input (upload section hidden)

4. **Reusable ImageUploader Component**
   - Created standalone `ImageUploader.tsx` component
   - Supports different accept types: 'image', 'video', or 'both'
   - Includes all functionality: drag-and-drop, preview, AI analysis, templates
   - Fully configurable with props for all features and event handlers

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users only see relevant upload options based on their content type choice
- **Cleaner UI**: Reduces visual clutter for text-only posts
- **Type Safety**: File input only accepts appropriate file types based on selection
- **Reusability**: New ImageUploader component can be used throughout the app
- **Maintainability**: Separated concerns and created modular components

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- Conditional rendering using `(selectedPostType === 'image' || selectedPostType === 'video')`
- Dynamic accept attribute: `selectedPostType === 'image' ? 'image/*' : selectedPostType === 'video' ? 'video/*' : 'image/*,video/*'`
- Proper state management for post type selection
- Maintained all existing functionality (AI analysis, templates, drag-and-drop, etc.)

### âœ¨ Design Consistency

- Uses existing purple gradient theme (`from-purple-600/90 to-purple-700/90`)
- Consistent with existing component styling and spacing
- Maintains theme colors and hover states
- Follows established design patterns

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The ContentInput component now provides a much more intuitive and focused user experience based on the selected post type.
