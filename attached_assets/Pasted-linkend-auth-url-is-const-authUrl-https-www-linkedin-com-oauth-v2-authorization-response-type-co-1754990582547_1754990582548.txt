linkend auth url is const authUrl = https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI)}&state=${state}&scope=${scope};
this the authUrl which in oauth.ts but why u r opening the other page from SocialMediaManager.tsx, why using so many files and creating problems for it fine tune the code

I understand your concern regarding how the LinkedIn authentication flow is implemented. The authUrl is constructed in the oauth.ts file, while the actual OAuth process is initiated from the SocialMediaManager.tsx component. Let's clarify the roles of these files and streamline the interaction.

Purpose of Each File
oauth.ts: This file handles the OAuth configuration and URL generation. It constructs the authUrl for initiating the LinkedIn OAuth flow.
SocialMediaManager.tsx: This React component is responsible for managing social media connections and triggering the OAuth flow by opening a new window with the authUrl.
Code Refinement
To ensure clarity, the process can be fine-tuned. Here's how you can simplify the interaction:

Keep the oauth.ts focused on OAuth URL generation.
Ensure the SocialMediaManager.tsx correctly handles the OAuth flow.
Suggested Changes
Make sure the oauth.ts contains the URL generation logic without any changes. The SocialMediaManager.tsx can remain largely as it is, but let's ensure it's using the authUrl appropriately.

Here's a minimal code snippet for clarity:

In oauth.ts, the relevant part is already good:

const authUrl = `https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI)}&state=${state}&scope=${scope}`;
In SocialMediaManager.tsx, ensure this function opens the OAuth window correctly:

const handleConnect = async (platform: Platform) => {
    try {
        setPlatformStatuses(prev =>
            prev.map(status =>
                status.platform === platform
                    ? { ...status, loading: true, error: undefined }
                    : status
            )
        );
        const authUrl = `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api/oauth'}/${platform}?user_id=${userId}`;
        
        const authWindow = window.open(
            authUrl,
            `${platform}_oauth`,
            'width=600,height=700,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'
        );
        // Add your message listener and other existing logic here
    } catch (error) {
        // Existing error handling
    }
};
Conclusion
This structure separates concerns effectively and maintains clean code by ensuring that oauth.ts is merely generating URLs and that SocialMediaManager.tsx is managing the OAuth interaction properly. If you implement the above suggestions, it should streamline the OAuth process without causing confusion or issues in the codebase.

it is not well the process starts from getting the code which is from m client side to linkedin directly

To improve the LinkedIn OAuth process, we want the flow to start directly from the client side, ensuring that the authorization code is received from LinkedIn. Here's a refined approach to how your current implementation can be restructured.
